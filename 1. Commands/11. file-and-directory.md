## Exit Status and Return Values

- Check the exit status of commands using $?.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir newdir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Directory created successfully"
else
    echo "Failed to create directory"
fi
```

- You can loop through files using a for loop and wildcards.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

- Checking if a File or Directory Exists

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -e file.txt ]; then
    echo "file.txt exists"
else
    echo "file.txt does not exist"
fi
```
